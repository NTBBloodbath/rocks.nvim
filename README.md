  (` "nvim-neorg/neorg" ` becomes `:Rocks install neorg` instead).
- Automatic dependency and build script management.
- Supports [multiple versions of the same dependency](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Using-LuaRocks#multiple-versions-using-the-luarocks-package-loader).
- True semver versioning!
- Minimal, non-intrusive UI.
- Async execution.
- Extensible, with a Lua API.
  - [`rocks-git.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-git.nvim)
    for installing from git repositories.
  - [`rocks-config.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim)
    for plugin configuration.
  - [`rocks-lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-lazy.nvim)
    for lazy-loading.
  - [`rocks-treesitter.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-treesitter.nvim)
    for automatic tree-sitter parser management.
  - And more...
- Command completions for plugins and versions on luarocks.org.
- Binary rocks pulled from [rocks-binaries](https://nvim-neorocks.github.io/rocks-binaries/)
  so you don't have to compile them.

![demo](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/assets/12857160/ce678546-76a7-4fdc-b822-e43d51652681)

## :moon: Introduction

rocks.nvim revolutionizes Neovim plugin management by streamlining the way users
and developers handle plugins and dependencies.
Integrating directly with [`luarocks`](https://luarocks.org),
this plugin offers an automated approach that shifts the responsibility
of specifying dependencies and build steps from users to plugin authors.

### :grey_question: Why rocks.nvim

The traditional approach to Neovim plugin management often places
an unjust burden on users.

Consider the following example using lazy.nvim[^2]:

```lua
{
  'foo/bar.nvim',
  dependencies = {
    'nvim-lua/plenary.nvim',
    'MunifTanjim/nui.nvim',
  },
  build = "make install" -- Post-install build step of the main plugin
}
```

[^2]: Since version `11.0.0`, lazy.nvim has basic support for luarocks.
      It will install luarocks dependencies if a repository has a `<plugin>-scm-1.rockspec` in its root directory.

This setup illustrates several pain points in the status quo:

- Manual dependency management:
  Users are often required to manually specify and manage dependencies.
- Breaking changes:
  Updates to a plugin's dependencies can lead to breaking changes for users.
- Platform-specific instructions:
  Build instructions and dependencies may vary by platform, adding complexity.
- Because of this horrible UX, plugin authors have been reluctant to
  add dependencies, preferring to copy/paste code instead.

rocks.nvim simplifies the above example to:

```
:Rocks install bar.nvim
```

Welcome to a new era of Neovim plugin management - where simplicity meets efficiency!

> [!NOTE]
>
> ##### What about `packspec`/`pkg.json`?
>
> We address `packspec` concerns [here](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/wiki/What-about-packspec-(pkg.json)%3F).

### :milky_way: Philosophy

rocks.nvim itself is designed based on the UNIX philosophy:
Do one thing well.

It doesn't dictate how you as a user should configure your plugins.
But there's an optional module for those seeking
additional configuration capabilities: [`rocks-config.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim).

We have packaged [many Neovim plugins and tree-sitter parsers](https://luarocks.org/modules/neorocks)
for luarocks, and an increasing number of plugin authors
[have been publishing themselves](https://luarocks.org/labels/neovim?non_root=on).
Additionally, [`rocks-git.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-git.nvim)
ensures you're covered even when a plugin isn't directly available on LuaRocks.

### :deciduous_tree: Enhanced tree-sitter support

We're revolutionizing the way Neovim users and plugin developers
interact with tree-sitter parsers.
With the introduction of the [Neovim User Rocks Repository (NURR)](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/nurr),
we have automated the packaging and publishing of many plugins and curated[^3] tree-sitter parsers
for luarocks, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

[^3]: We only upload parsers which we can install in the NURR CI
      (tested on Linux).

When installing, rocks.nvim will also search our [rocks-binaries (dev)](https://nvim-neorocks.github.io/rocks-binaries-dev/)
server, which means you don't even need to compile any parsers
on your machine.

#### Effortless installation for users

If you need a tree-sitter parser for syntax highlighting or other features,
you can easily install them with rocks.nvim: `:Rocks install tree-sitter-<lang>`.

They come bundled with queries, so once installed,
all you need to do is run `vim.treesitter.start()` to enable syntax highlighting[^4].

[^4]: You can put this in a `ftplugin/<filetype>.lua`, for example.

Or, you can use our [`rocks-treesitter.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-treesitter.nvim)
module, which can automatically install parsers and enable syntax highlighting for you.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you still need [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)
> for tree-sitter based folding, indentation, etc., but want to install parsers
> from luarocks, we recommend using our [nvim-treesitter-legacy-api](https://luarocks.org/modules/neorocks/nvim-treesitter-legacy-api)
> package. It does not include queries, which could conflict with the luarocks parsers.

<!-- Or, if you want something that comes with lots of tree-sitter parsers and -->
<!-- automatically configures nvim-treesitter for you, -->
<!-- check out our [`rocks-treesiter.nvim` module](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-treesitter.nvim). -->

> [!WARNING]
>
> - Tree-sitter is an experimental feature of Neovim.
>   As is the case with nvim-treesitter,
>   please consider tree-sitter support in rocks.nvim experimental.
>
> - We are not affiliated with the nvim-treesitter maintainers.
>   If you are facing issues with tree-sitter support in rocks.nvim,
>   please don't bug them.

#### Simplifying dependencies

For plugin developers, specifying a tree-sitter parser as a dependency
is now as straightforward as including it in their project's rockspec[^5].
This eliminates the need for manual parser management and ensures that
dependencies are automatically resolved and installed.

[^5]: [example](https://luarocks.org/modules/MrcJkb/neotest-haskell).

Example rockspec dependency specification:

```lua
dependencies = {
  "neotest",
  "tree-sitter-haskell"
}
```

## :pencil: Requirements

- An up-to-date `Neovim >= 0.10` installation.
- The `git` command line utility.
- `wget` or `curl` (if running on a UNIX system) - required for the remote `:source` command to work.
- `netrw` enabled in your Neovim configuration - enabled by default but some configurations manually disable the plugin.
- If you need to compile binary rocks from source: `lua 5.1` or `luajit` headers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are running on an esoteric architecture (i.e. something different to
> Linux, Windows or MacOS), `rocks.nvim` will attempt to compile its
> dependencies instead of pulling a pre-built binary. For the process to succeed
> you must have a **C++17 parser** and **Rust toolchain** installed on your
> system.

## :inbox_tray: Installation

### :zap: Installation script (recommended)

The days of bootstrapping and editing your configuration are over.
`rocks.nvim` can be installed directly through an interactive installer within Neovim.

We suggest starting nvim without loading RC files, such that already installed plugins do not interfere
with the installer:

```sh
nvim -u NORC -c "source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/master/installer.lua"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For security reasons, we recommend that you read `:help :source`
> and the installer code before running it so you know exactly what it does.

> [!TIP]
>
> To configure the luarocks installation to use a specific lua install,
> use environment variables `LUA_BINDIR=<Directory of lua binary>` and `LUA_BINDIR_SET=yes`.
>
> For example:
>
> `LUA_BINDIR="${XDG_BIN_DIR:-$HOME/.local/bin}" LUA_BINDIR_SET=yes nvim -u NORC -c "source ...`

### :rocket: Bootstrapping Script

For those who want `rocks.nvim` to automatically install itself whenever it isn't installed
one may use the bootstrapping script. Place the following script into your `init.lua`:

<details>
<summary>Lua Script</summary>

```lua
do
    -- Specifies where to install/use rocks.nvim
    local install_location = vim.fs.joinpath(vim.fn.stdpath("data"), "rocks")

    -- Set up configuration options related to rocks.nvim (recommended to leave as default)
    local rocks_config = {
        rocks_path = vim.fs.normalize(install_location),
    }

    vim.g.rocks_nvim = rocks_config

    -- Configure the package path (so that plugin code can be found)
    local luarocks_path = {
        vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_config.rocks_path, "share", "lua", "5.1", "?.lua"),
        vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_config.rocks_path, "share", "lua", "5.1", "?", "init.lua"),
    }
    package.path = package.path .. ";" .. table.concat(luarocks_path, ";")

    -- Configure the C path (so that e.g. tree-sitter parsers can be found)
    local luarocks_cpath = {
        vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_config.rocks_path, "lib", "lua", "5.1", "?.so"),
        vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_config.rocks_path, "lib64", "lua", "5.1", "?.so"),
    }
    package.cpath = package.cpath .. ";" .. table.concat(luarocks_cpath, ";")

    -- Load all installed plugins, including rocks.nvim itself
    vim.opt.runtimepath:append(vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_config.rocks_path, "lib", "luarocks", "rocks-5.1", "rocks.nvim", "*"))
end

-- If rocks.nvim is not installed then install it!
if not pcall(require, "rocks") then
    local rocks_location = vim.fs.joinpath(vim.fn.stdpath("cache"), "rocks.nvim")

    if not vim.uv.fs_stat(rocks_location) then
        -- Pull down rocks.nvim
        vim.fn.system({
            "git",
            "clone",
            "--filter=blob:none",
            "https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim",
            rocks_location,
        })
    end

    -- If the clone was successful then source the bootstrapping script
    assert(vim.v.shell_error == 0, "rocks.nvim installation failed. Try exiting and re-entering Neovim!")

    vim.cmd.source(vim.fs.joinpath(rocks_location, "bootstrap.lua"))

    vim.fn.delete(rocks_location, "rf")
end
```

</details>

Upon running `nvim` the bootstrapping script should engage!

> [!NOTE]
> If you would like to break down this snippet into separate files, *make sure*
> that the runtimepath and configuration snippet (the `do .. end` block) executes
> *before* the actual bootstrapping logic. You will get errors if you do it the other
> way around!

### :hammer: Manual installation

For manual installation, see [this tutorial](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/wiki/Installing-rocks.nvim-manually,-without-the-installation-script).

## :books: Usage

### Installing rocks

You can install rocks with the `:Rocks install {rock} {version?} {args[]?}` command.

Arguments:

- `rock`: The luarocks package.
- `version`: Optional. Used to pin a rock to a specific version.
- `args[]`: Optional arguments, e.g. `opt=true`, to prevent rocks.nvim
            from automatically sourcing a rock at startup.

Examples:

```vim
:Rocks install neorg
:Rocks install neorg 8.0.0
:Rocks install tree-sitter-toml dev
:Rocks install kanagawa.nvim opt=true
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The command provides fuzzy completions for rocks and versions on luarocks.org.
> - Installs the latest version if `version` is omitted.
> - This plugin keeps track of installed plugins in a `rocks.toml` file,
>   which you can commit to version control.
> - If you specify `dev` or `scm` as the version, luarocks will search the `dev`
>   manifest. This has the side-effect that it will prioritise `dev` versions
>   of any dependencies that aren't declared with version constraints.

### Updating rocks

Running the `:Rocks update` command will attempt to update every available rock
if it is not pinned.

### Syncing rocks

The `:Rocks sync` command synchronizes the installed rocks with the `rocks.toml`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Installs missing rocks.
> - Ensures that the correct versions are installed.
> - Uninstalls unneeded rocks.

### Uninstalling rocks

To uninstall a rock and any of its dependencies,
that are no longer needed, run the `:Rocks prune {rock}` command.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The command provides fuzzy completions for rocks that can safely
>   be pruned without breaking dependencies.

### Editing `rocks.toml`

The `:Rocks edit` command opens the `rocks.toml` file for manual editing.
Make sure to run `:Rocks sync` when you are done.

### Lazy loading plugins

> [!TIP]
>
> If you want more advanced lazy-loading capabilities,
> try out the [`rocks-lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-lazy.nvim) module.

By default, `rocks.nvim` will source all plugins at startup.
To prevent it from sourcing a plugin, you can specify `opt = true`
in the `rocks.toml` file.

For example:

```toml
[plugins]
neorg = { version = "1.0.0", opt = true }
```

or

```toml
[plugins.neorg]
version = "1.0.0"
opt = true
```

You can then load the plugin with Neovim's built-in `:packadd {rock}` command[^1].

[^1]: `rocks.nvim` maintains symlinks to installed rocks' plugin directories in
      a `site/pack/luarocks/opt/{rock}` directory, so colorschemes, etc., are available
      before `rocks.nvim` initializes.
      See also [`:h packadd`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#%3Apackadd).

> [!NOTE]
>
> #### A note on loading rocks
>
> Luarocks packages are installed differently than you are used to
> from Git repositories.
>
> Specifically, `luarocks` installs a rock's Lua API to the [`package.path`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/luaref.html#package.path)
> and the [`package.cpath`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/luaref.html#package.cpath)
> It does not have to be added to Neovim's runtime path
> (e.g. using `:packadd`), for it to become available.
> This does not impact Neovim's startup time.
>
> Runtime directories ([`:h runtimepath`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath')),
> on the other hand, are installed to a separate location.
> Plugins that utilise these directories may impact startup time
> (if it has `ftdetect` or `plugin` scripts), so you may or may
> not benefit from loading them lazily.

> [!TIP]
>
> #### Should I lazy load plugins?
>
> Making sure a plugin doesn't unnecessarily impact startup time
> [should be the responsibility of plugin authors, not users](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/nvim-best-practices?tab=readme-ov-file#sleeping_bed-lazy-loading).
> As is the case with dependencies, a plugin's functionality may evolve over
> time, potentially leading to breakage if it's the user who has
> to worry about lazy loading.
>
> A plugin that implements its own lazy initialization properly
> will likely have less overhead than the mechanisms used by a
> plugin manager or user to load that plugin lazily.
>
> If you find a plugin that takes too long to load,
> or worse, forces you to load it manually at startup with a
> call to a heavy `setup` function,
> consider opening an issue on the plugin's issue tracker.

### Pinning installed plugins

You can pin plugins with the `pin` field, so that they are skipped
by `:Rocks update`.

For example:

```toml
[plugins.neorg]
version = "7.0.0"
pin = true
```

Or

```vim
:Rocks install neorg 7.0.0 pin=true
```

You can also pin/unpin installed plugins with:

```vim
:Rocks [pin|unpin] {rock}
```

## :package: Extending `rocks.nvim`

This plugin provides a Lua API for extensibility.
See [`:h rocks.api`](./doc/rocks.txt) for details.

Following are some examples:

- [`rocks-git.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-git.nvim):
  Adds the ability to install plugins from git.
- [`rocks-config.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-config.nvim):
  Adds an API for safely loading plugin configurations.
- [`rocks-dev.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-dev.nvim):
  Adds an API for developing and testing luarocks plugins locally.
- [`rocks-treesitter.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks-treesitter.nvim)
  Automatic highlighting and installation of tree-sitter parsers.

To extend `rocks.nvim`, simply install a module with `:Rocks install`,
and you're good to go!

## :stethoscope: Troubleshooting

The `:Rocks log` command opens a log file for the current session,
which contains the `luarocks` stderr output, among other logs.
