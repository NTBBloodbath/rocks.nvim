## :star2: Features

- `Cargo`-like `rocks.toml` file for declaring all your plugins.
- Name-based installation
  (` "nvim-neorg/neorg" ` becomes `:Rocks install neorg` instead).
- Automatic dependency and build script management.
- True semver versioning!
- (WIP) Automatic running of test suites.

## :pencil: Requirements

- An up-to-date `Neovim` nightly (>= 0.10) installation.
- `git`
- If on a UNIX system: `wget` or `curl` - required for the remote `:source` command to work

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In the future we will provide the dependencies [already compiled through rocks](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/pull/15#discussion_r1375252696)
> and the C/C++ and Rust compilers will no longer be necessary.

## :hammer: Installation

### :zap: Installation script (recommended)

The days of bootstrapping and editing your configuration are over.
rocks.nvim can be installed directly through an interactive installer within Neovim.

You just have to run the following command inside your editor
and the installer will do the rest!

```vim
:source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/installer/installer.lua
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For security reasons, we recommend that you read `:help :source`
> and the installer code before running it so you know exactly what it does.

## :books: Usage

TODO...

## :book: License

rocks.nvim is licensed under GPLv3.
