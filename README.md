>
> They will be fledged out soon! :)

## :star2: Features

- `Cargo`-like `rocks.toml` file for declaring all your plugins.
- Name-based installation
  (` "nvim-neorg/neorg" ` becomes `:Rocks install neorg` instead).
- Automatic dependency and build script management.
- True semver versioning!
- (WIP) Automatic running of test suites.

## :pencil: Requirements

- An up-to-date `Neovim` nightly (>= 0.10) installation.
- The `git` command line utility.
- `wget` or `curl` (if running on a UNIX system) - required for the remote `:source` command to work.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are running on Windows or an esoteric architecture, `rocks.nvim` will
> attempt to compile its dependencies instead of pulling a prebuilt binary. For
> the process to succeed you must have a **C++17 parser** and **Rust
> toolchain** installed on your system.

## :hammer: Installation

### :zap: Installation script (recommended)

The days of bootstrapping and editing your configuration are over.
`rocks.nvim` can be installed directly through an interactive installer within Neovim.

You just have to run the following command inside your editor
and the installer will do the rest!

```vim
:source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvim-neorocks/rocks.nvim/master/installer.lua
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> For security reasons, we recommend that you read `:help :source`
> and the installer code before running it so you know exactly what it does.

## :books: Usage

### Installing rocks

You can install rocks with the `:Rocks install [rock] [version?]` command.

Arguments:

- `rock`: The luarocks package.
- `version`: Optional. Used to pin a rock to a specific version.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The command provides fuzzy completions for rocks and versions on luarocks.org.
> - Installs the latest version if `version` is omitted.
> - This plugin keeps track of installed plugins in a `rocks.toml` file,
>   which you can commit to version control.

### Updating rocks

Running the `:Rocks update` command will attempt to update every available rock
if it is not pinned.

### Syncing rocks

The `:Rocks sync` command synchronizes the installed rocks with the `rocks.toml`.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Installs missing rocks.
> - Ensures that the correct versions are installed.
> - Uninstalls unneeded rocks.

### Uninstalling rocks

To uninstall a rock and any of its dependencies,
that are no longer needed, run the `:Rocks prune [rock]` command.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The command provides fuzzy completions for rocks that can safely
>   be pruned without breaking dependencies.

### Editing `rocks.toml`

The `:Rocks edit` command opens the `rocks.toml` file for manual editing.
Make sure to run `:Rocks sync` when you are done.
